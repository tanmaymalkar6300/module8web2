    <p class="para">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a cornerstone technology for web design, used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual aesthetics of web pages, separating content from design for easier maintenance and flexibility. It allows for responsive design, adapting web layouts to various devices and screen sizes. CSS can be applied inline within HTML, embedded in the document's head, or linked as an external stylesheet. It uses selectors to target HTML elements and apply style rules, which include properties like margins, padding, borders, and positioning. CSS3, the latest version, introduced advanced features such as animations, transitions, and flexbox layout, enhancing interactivity and design capabilities. By enabling consistent, efficient styling across multiple pages, CSS plays a vital role in creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p>
